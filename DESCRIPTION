Description: Establishes an interface between R and 'QGIS', i.e.
    it allows the user to access 'QGIS' functionalities from the R
    console. It achieves this by using the 'QGIS' Python API via the
    command line. Hence, RQGIS extends R's statistical power by the
    incredible vast geo-functionality of 'QGIS' (including also 'GDAL',
    'SAGA'- and 'GRASS'-GIS among other third-party providers).  This in
    turn creates a powerful environment for advanced and innovative
    (geo-)statistical geocomputing. 'QGIS' is licensed under GPL version 2
    or greater and is available from <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/>.
